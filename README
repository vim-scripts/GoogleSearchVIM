 This plugin allows you to use Google Desktop Search engine to search text
 files on your hard drives (or network drives if configured in GDS) from within VIM. 
 This requires python, pygoogledesktop script, python windows extensions, and Google Desktop Search engine installed.
 Right now, this is a Windows only program, until I find time to modify it
 for other OS's.

This might get you quicker results instead of using vimgrep or grep.
